# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node

deploy lottery contract
yarn run ts-node --files ./scripts/Deploy.ts

open betting contract
yarn run ts-node --files ./scripts/OpenBets.ts "seconds_of_duration"
```
